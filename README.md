## Spring Boot and Elastic Search
This project demonstrates usage of Spring Boot and Elastic Search as primary data store.
In this demo, I was trying to experiment and do some benchmarks with inserting "a lot" of data
into Elastic Search and query them in some moment.

## Getting started
For starting the project you should install Elastic Search on your local computer or 
install it using Docker (I prefer using Docker Images/Containers).

Steps:
1. Open terminal, navigate to project directory and run command: `mvn clean install -DskipTests`
2. Run command: `docker-compose build`
3. Run command: `docker-compose up -d`. This command will start Elasic Search as Docker service
4. Run Spring Boot project

## API service
